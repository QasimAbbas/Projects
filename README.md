## CAVE Projects

[Automate Fill for Tickets]()
* Being an iLab Assistant you have to make tickets every time someone needs helps for statistics for the CAVE.  Unfortunatley the entry process is very tedious with a ton of repetitive tasks to just enter in the content of a ticket.
  * Selenium
  * Chrome Extension

[HelpQ for iLab Assistants]()
* The CAVE is a place to go if you have question about your homework or better yet information about the Computer Science program and community.  Unfortuntately there is no automated way to keep track of who needs help or anything like that.  To have that.  This tool would be able to keep track of who needs help and give statistics of the shift as well.

[Fix Bean]()
* Bean is the CAVE's little Raspberry Pi.  He is used to display bus times and inspirational quotes and such.  Unfortunately he was feeling a bit under the weather and now needs a fresh OS install.

[Bus Times LED]()
