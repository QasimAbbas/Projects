# Projects
A repo dedicated to project descriptions of stuff that I am working on/want to work on so they can finally be completed or someone would be able to pick them up

## CAVE Projects

[Automate Fill for Tickets](#cave-projects)
* Being an iLab Assistant you have to make tickets every time someone needs helps for statistics for the CAVE.  Unfortunatley the entry process is very tedious with a ton of repetitive tasks to just enter in the content of a ticket.
  * Selenium
  * Chrome Extension

[HelpQ for iLab Assistants](#cave-projects)
* The CAVE is a place to go if you have question about your homework or better yet information about the Computer Science program and community.  Unfortuntately there is no automated way to keep track of who needs help or anything like that.  To have that.  This tool would be able to keep track of who needs help and give statistics of the shift as well.

[Fix Bean](#cave-projects)
* Bean is the CAVE's little Raspberry Pi.  He is used to display bus times and inspirational quotes and such.  Unfortunately he was feeling a bit under the weather and now needs a fresh OS install.

[Bus Times LED](#cave-projects)
* We have a cool lit board in the CAVE but the information isn't as useful on it as we want it to be!  Try to start off with adding bus times of Hill Cente stop and expand from there!

[CAVE Mobile App](#cave-projects)
* A way for people to see what is happening in the CAVE.  From events to who's on duty to amount of people being helped.  An application to track all of that information!

[CAVE Website](#cave-projects)
* A way for people to see what is happening in the CAVE.  From events to who's on duty to amount of people being helped.  A web application to track all of that information!

## HackRU Projects

[Travel Reimbursements](#hackru-projects)
* Create a way to track who is traveling from where and any way to connect and help them out with navigating to the hackathon or any hackathon as well as carpool with people coming from similar areas.  This will also act as a calculator for an estimate that can be used by our hackathon based off of our budget

## Rutgers Projects

* Kiran's old application!  A way to take your class schedule from Webreg and put it into a google calendar with the push of a button

[RU CourseMap](#hackru-projects)
* A small application that can tell you the track of course you want to take and plan out your college career at Rutgers University.  Mapping out prerequistes and credits and all.
